# How to setup

At first, you have to install all required dependencies using:

```bash
npm i
```

In the next step you create a `.env` file in the root of the project with following values:

```
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=
```

Both of them should be around 512 bits of size in the best case!

Now you can run the app using:

```
npm run serve
```

Have fun! :D
